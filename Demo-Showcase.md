# Demo showcase:


## 1. Make a Sound App:
EXERCISE 1:
> Open the folder
> Make sure there's no possible to run an app:
[x] node_modules deleted
[x] explain the code of an /app, bref review (page.tsx / layout.tsx / global.css ./lib/audioplayer.tsx)
> run terminal with npm / pnpm dev, display its not working correctly

[COPILOT] How to run app from @workspace using pnpm? I got an error: sh: next: command not found â€‰ELIFECYCLEâ€‰ Command failed. â€‰WARNâ€‰ Local package.json exists, but node_modules missing, did you mean to install?
> Execute necessary commands in CoPilot:
- Ensure pnpm is installed: Verify that pnpm is installed globally by running pnpm --version. If not, install it using npm install -g pnpm.
- Install dependencies: Run pnpm install in the root of your workspace to install all dependencies.
- Run the app: Use pnpm dev to start the Next.js development server.
- Check package.json scripts: Ensure the dev script is defined in your package.json:

> run pnpminstall from Copilot
> App started to work: explain the UI and potential fixes required:

EXERCISE 2:
[x] Explain the position of  
<div className="flex gap-4 items-center flex-col sm:flex-row">
    I made this change to get a better understanding of how to use the Next.js framework.
    <AudioPlayer />
</div> 
[x] Move the <AudioPlayer /> component above
[x] select the component and runcopilot CMD+I with following prompt:
> [COPILOT] center this component using tailwind
[x] Show: RE-RUN options

> Paste an image from your clipboard
> Attach a screenshot of the VS Code window (select the paperclip ðŸ“Ž button > Screenshot Window)

A warning is shown if the selected model currently does not have the capability to handle the file type. The only supported model at the moment will be GPT 4o, but support for image attachments with Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Gemini 2.0 Flash will be rolling out soon as well. Currently, the supported image types are JPEG/JPG, PNG, GIF, and WEBP.
