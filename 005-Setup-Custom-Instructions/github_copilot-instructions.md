<!-- When Copilot generates code or answers questions, it tries to match your coding practices and preferences such as which libraries you use or how you name your variables. However, it might not always have enough context to do this effectively. For example, if you work with a specific framework version, you need to provide additional context in your prompts.

To enhance Copilot's responses, you can use custom instructions to provide it with contextual details about your team's workflow, tools, or project specifics. Copilot then incorporates these custom instructions with every request. -->
